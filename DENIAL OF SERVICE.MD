Conclusion
Based on the material that has been described, entitled DoS, it can be concluded that basically already have a policy governing criminal law related to misuse of the information. But in law enforcement still need firm action and awareness of law enforcement and legal subjects who run it. In addition it is the policy of criminal law itself does have its drawbacks and advantages of each. The downside of any criminal legal policy in general or specific criminal law in the form of regulations and legislation should be the proper legal remedies. In meeting the needs and settlement of national problems. Every criminal law policy governing the information technology crimes required no overlap in order not to clash in law inforcement realization of the charge material.


Suggestion
It is undeniable that the current reality is that the legislation is used as a criminal law policy tackling every crime is still not optimal. Not effectively be solving legal problems and needs of each community. Still their respective charge material which laping over each other or overlap. So that should be the establishment of criminal law policy with methods that are not glossed over. Although it is at worst a law if implemented with a process and a good cause will certainly produce good results. Unfortunately the law in Indonesia is good, but enforcement and legal awareness of the law enforcement agencies and legal subjects that should be corrected
