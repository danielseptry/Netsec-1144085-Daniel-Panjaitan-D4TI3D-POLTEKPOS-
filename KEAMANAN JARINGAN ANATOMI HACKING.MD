uk mendeteksi Hacker. Dalam hal ini, Organisasi ahrus memiliki keamanan professional yang diperlukan untuk memanfaatkan konsep perlindungan. Contoh kegiatan yang dilakukan Hacker dalam langkah ini meliputi : Backdooring, RootKits, Trojans, dan Trojan Horse Backdoors. Clearing Attacks Langkah dimana Hacker menghapus atau membersihkan jejak, bukti kehadiran, maupun aktivitas agar sistem korban merasa tidak ada sesuatu yang salah dan juga tentunya untuk menjaga akses terhadap sistem yang telah diambil alih dan menghindari adanya deteksi. Contoh kegiatan yang dilakukan Hacker dalam langkah ini meliputi : Steganography, Tunneling, menghapus file log dan lain-lain KESIMPULAN Dalam Anatomy of Hacking, memuat langkah-langkah yang diperlukan dalam aktifitas Hacking sehingga dapat dilakukan secara runtut dan terperinci. Banyak cara yang dilakukan dalam setiap langkah dalam Anatomy of Hacking, yang tentunya sangat variatif sehingga akan cukup menyulitkan untuk diatasi. Oleh karena itu, Network Administrator dituntut untuk cepat dan tanggap dalam menghadapi ancaman Hacker yang dapat menyerang kapan saja dan dengan berbagai cara ataupun teknik yang beragam.
BACKGROUND
One of telecommunication technology that is in demand and widely used wireless technology, known as wireless technology. Wireless technology does have some advantages among is simple and practical, to take advantage of this technology people do not bother to pull the network cable computer so we can enjoy the internet, so kesemerawutan because the number of cable lines that usually occurs and causes the landscape becomes less unsightly can minimized. Wireless technology that is now loved and widely applied in many public places such as: Mall, airports, hotels, cafes, campuses, offices, parks and even public housing residents (RT / RW Net) is a WiFi technology.
On this occasion, the material to be discussed is the anatomy of hacking, where hacking is a step anatomy systematically arranged which can be done for the hacking process that can be used in conducting hacker attacks with the aim that compromise the network.

DISCUSSION

ANATOMY OF UNDERSTANDING
Anatomy of Hacking (Hacking Anatomy) is a systematic measures that can be done in the process of Hacking. Anatomy Hacking can be used to withstand hacker attacks aimed at negatively on our network security system. Therefore, structured steps will further facilitate the protection of the assets of the organization effectively and efficiently.
   The following are the steps in the Anatomy Hacking is Sebai follows:
Reconnaissance
scanning
Gaining Access
maintaining Access
Clearing Tracks
For a description of the steps in hacking Anatomy will be presented as described below.
Steps
On this occasion will be explained what are the steps in the following Hacking Anatomy explanation of each step and example.
Reconnaissance
Grammatically Reconnaissance Surveillance has meaning, specifically, is to map the network and explore a network. This attack was carried out to find the weak spots on the network that will be the victim. In this step, the success of a determined hacker how rigor in learning all about the network that will be targeted victims and seek as much information. In this step, there is not a form of disruption to the victim network. There are two forms of activities undertaken in this reconnaissance measures, among others:
Passive Reconnaissance: Event monitor data through computer networks, analyze and draw conclusions from the information obtained without changing the data packets. Example: Sniffing, and Information Gathering
Active Reconnaissance: Event to gain access to the information system network by searching for the target system. Usually involving port scanning, firewall or router. The process of system utilization then performed after a hacker has found a way to access the system. Example: Accessing host, look for ports, the location of the router, and details of the OS used.
scanning
Stages of pre-attack where hackers gather network information that is more specific than the victims of the previous step Reconnaissance. Scanning can be analogized as a thief looking for doors or windows that can be penetrated. Scanning can also be interpreted as a form of detection system is still alive and can be accessed via the internet and what services are offered. This stage is a high risk, if the hacker can find the weaknesses of a system, then the hacker can exploit this network.
Examples of activities carried Hacker in this step include: Ping Sweeps, Port Scanning, and others.
Gaining Access
Is the most important step of attacking in terms of potential damage, although hackers do not always have access to the system to cause damage.
Factors that affect the likelihood of an attacker gaining access to the system, including the architecture and configuration, user and admin level skills, and access levels.
Examples of activities carried Hacker in this step include: BufferOverFlows, DoS (Denial of Service), Session Hijacking, and others.
maintaining Access
After Hackers gained access to the network of victims, in this step Hacker master the system and trying to maintain the "Ownership of the system that has been mastered, which means that hackers have successfully exploited the weakness of the victim system. In other words, hackers have taken over the system. Here also Hackers can establish a defense for the system that has been in the "have" it can not be taken back by the administrator or other hacker who also wants to get his access to the network system.
Organizations can also do defense attacked using intrus detection system (IDS) or deploy honeypots and Honeynets unt
