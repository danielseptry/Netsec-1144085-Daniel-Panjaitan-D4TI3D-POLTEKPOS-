Background
            A firewall is a system or device that allows network traffic that is considered safe for traffic through it and prevent an unsecured network. Generally, a firewall is implemented in a dedicated machine, which runs on the gate (gateway) between the local network and other networks. Firewalls are also commonly used to control access to anyone who has access to a private network from outside parties. Today, the term firewall becomes a generic term that refers to a system that manages the communication between two different networks.
 Given today many companies that have access to the Internet and also of course the corporate network in it, then the protection of the company's digital assets from attack by hackers, espionage offenders, thieves or other data, becomes essential.
Due to lack of knowledge of firewalls, the authors raised the matter on a firewall to help readers find out about the firewall.
