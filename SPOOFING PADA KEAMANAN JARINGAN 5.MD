Background
At the time of this increasing, many people are using the Internet to communicate and to other things. Along with the times, the needs of the Internet network is very diverse, but few people are concerned with the security of the network they use. Thus providing a wide gap for people who are not responsible for the use. One example is people will provide false addresses so that people will be stuck with a fake address, such as by spoofing. Spoofing This is an English term derived from the word spoof, spoof is to imitate the activities of bogus addresses. Jadis poofing is the process of giving a false address to the victim, so the victim would get stuck when following the fake address. Therefore, through this pathway target access rights can be known by the person doing the sniffing so it can be easy to use access rights are targeted.

spoofing
Spoofing This is an English term derived from the word spoof, spoof is to imitate the activities of bogus addresses. So spoofing is a process of giving a false address to the victim, so the victim would get stuck when following the fake address. If you have followed a false address tesbut then it stuck. There are two types - type Spoofing:
1. Arp, is deceiving victims by providing fake MAC address, the form of the table shows the IP and MAC.
2. DNS, is deceiving victims by providing fake IP, the shape of the table contains Domain and IP.
Example Process For ARP:
R router as an access point, this router will pass the data to the internet can only be to the intense, his way is a must see physical address existing router in the address, it can send a packet to the Internet. For more details clay explanation below:
1. A wants to communicate to the internet so that A must pass through the router R in order to get to the Internet. His manner is a need to look at the physical address of the router which is in Address
2. A router R can go to and look at her address table or the ARP table, it can see the packets that can be forwarded on to the Internet.
3. A B wants to cheat so as not up to the internet by providing false tabael. Providing false table to be updated on his table, so that the router's physical address B where B is himself.
4. So A look at the table fake sent by B, and B is thought Router, therefore flow to the Internet is disconnected
Example Process For DNS:
A wish to enter google.com google.com but it turned out the contents adala d localhost B just wrote.
Differences table in the ARP and DNS is, if it is Arp ARP table, if DNS is Domain.
How to Tackle is as follows:
1. Do not accept a table from anyone.
2. Create a static table that can not be changed or updated. Make sure no one gives a false table in a way, create a table fiks that can not be updated, including a router if it gives update the ARP table has no effect, so had to make the ARP table fiks.

phishing
Phishing is tehknik to copy the structure of the website, so the example most often is click the BCA. www.klikBCA.com but nothing makes fraudulent or criminal content duplication website at alamatwww.clickBCA.com, meaning that if spoken by ordinary people will tend to use click BCA so that the open website. Shape similar to the site.
We can detect this phishing or not by the way: Looking at https certificate verified by the organization
Conclusion
IP Spoofing is a problem without an easy solution, because it is inherent to the design of the TCP / IP suite. Understanding how dang why spoofing attacks are used, combined with some simple pencengahan methods, can help protect your jaingan of malicious cloaking and cracking techniques.
