Background
In this increasing age, many people who uses the Internet to communicate and to other things. Seiringperkembangan this day and age, the Internet network needs are very diverse, but few people are concerned with the security of the network they use. Thus providing a wide gap for people who are not responsible for the use. One example is a person who accesses a way that is not good, as by sniffing. Sniffing is one way to do intercepting network. So, people who do sniffing will easily fit into the lane where there is about a man who connected the data packet data network n premises. So that data packets will be passed by people who do sniffing. Therefore, through this pathway target access rights can be known by the person doing the sniffing so it can be easy to use access rights are targeted.
Discussion
In python we can use OOP by:
1. Create a file anu.py
2. Contents:
From socket import socket, AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM
Class Anu (object):
                              Def ISOPEN (self, IPADD, Pord):
                        S = socket (AF_INET, SOCK_SREAM.
                        RETURN s.connect.ex ((IPADD, PORT))

3. Call in the main program / console
Import anu
4. instantiation to variable
a = anu.Anu ()
5. Call method
a.isOpen (www.poltekpos.ac.id.22)
o = open
sniffing
What it Sniffing ???
Sniffing is an activity to read the data packets circulating in the network, each computer on the network that would put the packet, IP packet is sent kejaringan, substantially in the form of a cable network. Suppose there is a computer, connected by a switch to make use of the cable, the cable contained package, with the package then tersambunglah on the switch so that the package arrived, and d can be forwarded to another computer. That is how penggunaanswitch. While the hub, it's a different way again that the hub directly sending the package without the pemilan, while a switch was the opposite of the hub. Therefore, Sniffing is the practice of reading the IP packets from one node to another node. By having a method that is by intercepting network / entrance to the path, where the packets through that way (Bullying). So in intercepting we will do the bullying on the network. Sniffing Tools divided into three, namely wire sharh, TCP dump, and Socket python.
Example scenario:
1. Wifi campus
2. Laptop lecturer
3. Student Laptop
How to account menggukan lecturers, that way is as follows:
1) Network wifi laptop contained campus faculty and student laptop belonging to a single access point.
2) Students open the sniffer in the laptop.
3) Lecturer hotspot login with it with sense lecturer save the package in the form of a wifi network user, password from post HTML method.
4) Sniffer in the data capture student laptop.
5) Students wear it to the hotspot login using the account lecturer.

How to Use / Counter messure by Securing:
1) Change HTTP to HTTPS.
2) Use AES encryption / more timggi on HTTPS encryption.
Conclusion
Sniffing is tapping in data traffic on the network computer with other people reading the IP packet by using a device. Sniffer is a computer networking device interception of communications by utilizing premicious mode on Ethernet.
Suggestion
Sniffing is not a good thing, because it can harm others. If you try to do the sniffing then you must take responsibility for your own work
